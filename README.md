# This repo will be restructured!
As those IDs will be unique for every console, I'll make this repo into an instruction on how to obtain the IDs yourself. I'll try to keep it updated if there is any update that changes how you can access them on your Xbox.

# app-list-for-homebridge-smartglass

This repo aims to help configuring the [homebridge-smartglass](https://github.com/unknownskl/homebridge-smartglass) plugin. As [Microsoft ended support for Smartglass](https://twitter.com/majornelson/status/998790240377565184) the Title ID in listTable.txt is just a nice to have but apps won't be launchable anymore.


## Things to note
The TitleID seems to be unique for every installation, below you can see how to get it.

## You can help expanding the list

If you have set up [homebridge-smartglass](https://github.com/unknownskl/homebridge-smartglass) or [homebridge-xbox-tv](https://github.com/grzegorz914/homebridge-xbox-tv), you can get the information for launched software right from your Homebridge logs.<br />
To access those informations on your XBox, do the following:<br />

1st Navigate to the app or game you want to add.<br />
2nd Use the menu button and select "Manage app"<br />
